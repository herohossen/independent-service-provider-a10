                <h2>Difference between authorization and authentication</h2>
                <p>Both authorization and authentication are used for security purposes</p>
                <p>Authorization is related to user permission like super user, admin, normal user<br /> where as authentication
                    is related to user access like login</p>
                <p>Authorization determines whether the user is authorized to access
                    the resources<br />where as authentication confirms the identity of the user</p>
                <p>Authorization verifies user  whether access is allowed or not
                    <br />Where as authentication validated user credentials to gain user access.</p>
                <p>Authorization happens after the user authenticated</p>
                <p>Authorization may vary, depending on the security level <br />where as authentication usually requires a userName and password</p>
